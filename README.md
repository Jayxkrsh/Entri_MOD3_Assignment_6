Inner Join: Retrieves records that have matching entries in both tables.
Left Join: Returns all records from the Country table and matched records from the Persons table, including NULLs for unmatched records.
Right Join: Returns all records from the Persons table and matched records from the Country table, including NULLs for unmatched records.
Distinct Country Names: Lists unique country names from both tables.
Country Names Including Duplicates: Lists all country names from both tables, allowing duplicates.
Round Ratings: Rounds the ratings of individuals in the Persons table to the nearest integer.
The queries can be executed in an SQL environment connected to the entri_d41 database.
